Bekolay et al., 2014: behind the scenes
=======================================

This repository explains how I prepared
a recent publication,
*A spiking neural integrator model of
the adaptive control of action
by the medial prefrontal cortex*.
In particular, I attempt to go over several
of the tools that I found extremely useful
in creating the paper,
both in making it easy for me to make changes,
and in making it easy for other people
to reproduce the results.
While these tools are most relevant to
people using Python (with NumPy and Matplotlib)
for coding and LaTeX for document preparation,
some of these tools and/or the concepts
could be applied to other similar tools
(though I will not discuss those alternatives here).

I present these tools through IPython notebooks,
which is coincidentally one of the tools I talk about.
Other tools include:

- [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/)
  & [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [python-neo](http://pythonhosted.org/neo/)
- [svgutils](https://github.com/btel/svg_utils)
- [doit](http://pydoit.org/)
- [Github releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software)
- [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
- [latexdiff](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2013/02/16/using-latexdiff-for-marking-changes-to-tex-documents.htm)
